# skmer2_eqn_analysis
## Overview
This repository contains the source code for the research pipeline implementing and testing Skmer2 (improved genomic distance estimation between genome skims using $k$-mer repeat spectra information). It contains Bash scripts for creating and combining KMC databases of genomic data, along with Python scripts for computing the Skmer2 equation performance and other related $k$-mer statistics.
